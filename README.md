This is a tile memory game based on a puzzle in the video game "Lego Indiana Jones - The Original Adventures", released in 2008.  In this game, the computer picks 4 random tiles from a 3x3 board (9 tiles) and shows them to the player.  The player then has to select the tiles in the same order. If the player selects them correctly, something gets unlocked - usually a treasure or passage to another level.
